abstract: "This paper expands the applied researcher's toolkit for dealing with nonlinear panel data models with unobserved heterogeneity using multivariate fractional outcomes. It presents a wide range of methods that include maximum likelihood estimation for identifying the parameters of a conditional mean, a simple probit approach to identify average partial effects, and a Bayesian estimator from a latent dependent variable specification to account for corner outcomes. I then show how all these methods can be modified to handle continuous endogenous covariates. A range of simulation exercises showcase the comparative advantages of each method and how they might be used to approach different situations that arise in applied microeconomics."
